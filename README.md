# VessMAP: Feature-**Map**ped Cortex Vasculature Dataset

On 'seed_paper.ipynb', we provide a snippet of the experiments we ran for the paper. However, this notebook is not supposed to run since it needs the full cortex dataset, which is not provided in this repository.

At 'usage_example.py', we show an example of how to use 'image_selection.py' with an image dataset. We provide a subset of the cortex dataset with 10 images for this.
