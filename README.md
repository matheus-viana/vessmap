# VessMAP: Feature-**Map**ped Cortex Vasculature Dataset

The file 'usage_example.py' contains an example of how to generate a diverse set of samples from a larger dataset using the same methodology developed in the paper. We provide a subset of the Cortex dataset with 10 images to run the script.

In 'seed_paper.ipynb', we include a snippet of the experiments conducted for the paper. However, the notebook is not intended to be run, as it requires the full Cortex dataset, which is not included in this repository.
